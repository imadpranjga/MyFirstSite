He is the spouse of Marge Simpson and father of Bart Simpson, Lisa Simpson, and Maggie Simpson.Homer is overweight (said to be ~240 lbs), lazy, and often ignorant to the world around him.

<h1>Facts</h1>
<p>Homer works as a low-level safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7G, although he is often incompetent and negligent towards his duty. He spends a great deal of his time at Moe's Tavern with his lifelong friends Barney, Carl, Lenny, and the bartender Moe. At his home, he can often be found sitting on the couch mindlessly watching TV while snacking on food and drinking Duff. Homer is also the only son of Abe and Mona. When Homer gets provoked, he strangles Bart for pressuring him. Even though he hates Patty and Selma, he played as Selmaâ€™s husband in order for her to adopt Ling.</p>
